# Connect-Four-Slide-
My personal version of Connect Four. Rules are as follows:

1) Just like regular Connect Four, four disks lined up in any direction is a win.
2) However, disks can be inserted from either side of any row.
3) Gravity is still in force, so if a disk is pushed to the side with nothing beneath it, it will fall.
4) Empty spaces will be filled by sliding rows, and if the whole row is full, then a newly inserted disk will push the opposite end out of the game board.
5) A win may come from any move, whether a drop in a column or a slide in a row, so watch for how things can change.
6) Finally, if you make a move that causes a connected four for your opponent, your opponent wins. This is true even if your move creates your own connected four.
7) Additionally, repeating the same board state three times results in a draw.
